## Overview

For our first project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to address our problem statement.

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.

### Conclusion/Suggestion

Most states are heavily leaning towards only one test. The support and resources that the students are receiving is on one of the two tests. This can be problematic for students who are can perform better on test that the state didnâ€™t mandate.
Based on the data, it is suggested that students should be given the opportunity to take both tests, due to differing strengths and weaknesses of each individual student.
